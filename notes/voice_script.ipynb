{"cells":[{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["tutor: Hi there! Let's take a look at your code and see what's going on.\n","\n","student: Great, thanks for your help! I'm not really sure where to start.\n","\n","tutor: No problem, let's take a look at the error message you're getting first. It says `NameError: name 'api_key' is not defined`. This means that the variable `api_key` hasn't been defined yet. \n","\n","student: Okay, I think I see what you mean.\n","\n","tutor: Great, so let's define the `api_key` variable. It looks like you've assigned a value to `api_key`, but you haven't enclosed it in quotes. We need to put quotes around the value so that it's interpreted as a string. \n","\n","student: Ah, I see what you mean now. Okay, I've added the quotes around the value. \n","\n","tutor: Excellent, let's try running the code now and see if that error message goes away. \n","\n","student: Okay, I'm running the code now... and it looks like the error message is gone!\n","\n","tutor: Wonderful! Now, let's take a look at the next error message. It says `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'cities.txt'`. This means that the program is looking for a file called `cities.txt` and can't find it.\n","\n","student: Hm, okay. I'm not really sure where the issue is.\n","\n","tutor: Let's take a look at the line of code that specifies the file path. It looks like you've specified the file path as `\"\"cities.txt\"\"`, but there are a couple of issues with this. First, the file is actually called `cities.csv`, not `cities.txt`. And second, the quotes around the file name shouldn't be doubled up like that. \n","\n","student: Oh, I see. I'll fix that now.\n","\n","tutor: Great! Let's run the code again and see if that error message goes away.\n","\n","student: Okay, running the code now... and it looks like the error message is gone!\n","\n","tutor: Fantastic! Now let's move on to the next issue. It looks like the program is only printing out the first city in the list, but we want it to print out all of the cities.\n","\n","student: Right, I noticed that too. \n","\n","tutor: One way we could fix this is by moving the line `output_file = \"output.csv\"` outside of the for loop. That way, the file will only be created once, and we can write to it multiple times within the loop.\n","\n","student: Ah, I see what you mean. I'll move that line outside of the loop now.\n","\n","tutor: Great! And now, let's create a function that we can use to test whether the program is working correctly. We'll call it `test_weather_finder()`. This function will take in a list of cities and their corresponding temperatures, and it will compare them to the expected values.\n","\n","student: Okay, I think I can do that.\n","\n","tutor: Excellent! And remember to commit your progress frequently, so that you can easily roll back changes if something goes wrong. \n","\n","student: Okay, I'll do that. Thanks for your help!\n","\n","tutor: No problem, happy to help! And remember, always run your code frequently and check the console for error messages. And don't be afraid to use Google to find solutions to problems you encounter along the way. Good luck!\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"},"orig_nbformat":4},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
