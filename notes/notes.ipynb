    "Situational Questions:\n",
    "Feel free to review this informational video for the situational questions.\n",
    "Scenario #1\n",
    "While meeting with a student, Jamal, you learn that he is planning to drop out of the boot camp. He reports that he has been successful on the projects so far, but he feels the class is moving too fast. He says that he feels very self conscious about not being as skilled as other students and that he consistently has to use Google to find answers to problems. You have about 5 minutes to discuss this decision with him before class starts. In a 2-3 minute Zoom video recording, act out how you might help Jamal with his problem, being sure to address both his self consciousness and the resources he can use to keep himself on track.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario #2\n",
    "While working with a student, you share the solution for a problem using the method taught by the instructor in class. The student, Steff, says that she researched the problem and found a solution that seems easier using a method that is different than what was taught in class. She says she is frustrated that she was taught a more difficult method, when there was a very easy shortcut that wasn’t taught at all. She is worried that the material being taught isn’t the most useful, and doesn’t understand why she needs to learn it. You know that the shortcut Steff describes doesn’t work in every case, and that the method taught in class will be necessary for skills taught later in the boot camp.  In a written response of at least 1,000 characters, describe how you would respond to Steff’s concerns. Be sure to address her frustration and the fact that the skills she learns now may connect to other skills she needs in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario #3\n",
    "A student, Leo, comes to you because they are stuck on a particular problem. After examining their work you see that they completed about 80% of the work and have made a couple of small errors that led to them being stuck. You would like to give Leo feedback that guides them to the errors they have made so that they can have the experience of finding and solving the problem independently. In a written response of at least 1,000 characters, describe how you would give feedback to Leo in a way that guides their thinking and learning, rather than solving the problem for them. \n",

    "Technical Challenge(s):\n",
    "Feel free to review this informational video for the technical challenge(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the technical challenge, the student will be struggling with this exercise involving use of the csv module in Python - You will be responding to this video in CodeSignal. We encourage you to download the files and share your screen as you record your submission. Keep in mind that this is much less about fixing errors and more about offering guidance to the student. Don’t worry if you’re not a Python expert! In a 5-7 minute Zoom video recording, act out how you might help this student with their issues and struggles, be sure to be encouraging, clear and resourceful!\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this technical challenge is for you to provide the student with specific steps in order to resolve their issue. You want to make sure that you are encouraging critical thinking and promoting self reliance. Make sure to explain how you would approach this so that the student can pick up on your process. In addition, here are more suggestions of what we would like to see in your video response:\n",
    "Empathy/Encouragement\n",
    "Sharing resources\n",
    "Providing step-by step directions \n",
    "\n",
    "Have fun with this! This is really your chance to show off your teaching skills and will be similar to what you would be doing in the class or as a Tutor, Learning Assistant or Grader. Really own the situation and let your personality shine throughout your responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "REMEMBER: The key is to show the student how to solve the problem. It's not really about solving the problem or the speed in which you do so - it's about how you are able to guide the student. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For an idea of our rubric, and how you will be graded, please review these Classroom Do’s and Don’ts\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are a few tips that can be helpful during the final interview! They are also things we like instructional team members to keep top of mind when interacting with students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asking the goal of the activity \n",
    "It helps to ask the goal of the code right away. Asking the goal of the code gets you up to speed on what the code is supposed to be doing and then allows you to already put the pieces together on how to get the code functioning properly. Listen to the student and get them talking so you can gauge their level of understanding. Remember that this is a conversation with the student. Always ask them questions about their work so far, or their understanding of the assignment. We want the student to be an active participant in the problem solving process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Running the code\n",
    "Stress the importance of running the code early and often. We want the students to know how to use feedback from the terminal/console. We really want our students to know that as soon as they see an issue, they need to open up the console. They might not fully understand how to interpret the information it yields. Explain to them how to use this information to help with their issues (ie what line is an error on?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t give away the answer\n",
    "You definitely do not want to give away any answers to the student, but you can guide the student to the right answer by asking them relevant questions to get them thinking in the right direction. Instead of telling the student what the errors mean, it’s really important for you to ask the student what they think the errors mean in their own words. Once you get them using Google, you can ask the student to compare their syntax in their code to the syntax on Google. That’s a great strategy for the student to figure out the issues in their code without you directly telling them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Online Research and going to Google\n",
    "Remind the student to utilize Google. If the student doesn't understand what an error means or how to solve something, have them Google it. We want them to understand that it is okay to look things up, and they don't need to memorize all the answers - but they need to know how to find them. You are probably going to end up on Stack Overflow, so feel free to show the student how it works. At this point in their career, it is likely the student does not know what Stack Overflow is, and is maybe even intimidated by it. Show them how it works, explain the importance of reading the question thoroughly to check if it pertains to their issue, explain why we might be interested in one answer over another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empathy and Encouragement \n",
    "Lastly, we really love when our team focuses on boosting the students' self confidence.  This is going to be an emotional time for a lot of them, and bootcamps are notoriously difficult! They've invested a lot into this class, and many are going to be working full time jobs while studying in the evenings. So, focus on giving the student positive validation, and encouragement that they need to hear throughout the entire process. Make sure to cheer them along as they clear errors from the terminal/console, praise code that they have right, show the student that you are a partner and give them the shoulder of support they need. Think back to when you were learning how to code, and show some empathy towards the student experience.\n",
