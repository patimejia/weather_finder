# Weather Finder

The Weather Finder is a Python script that retrieves the current weather of each city listed in a provided CSV file using the OpenWeatherMap API. It prints a running list of JSONs for each city in the console and saves the city names and temperatures in a new CSV file.

> The following step is optional and might take 1-2 minutes

The Weather Finder uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data. You will need to create an account and generate an API key to use the API. If the inclued API key is no longer valid, you can generate ypur own API key by creating an account [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).

Once you create an account and log in, you can quickly generate a new API Key [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys).

After you generate your API key, you can add it to the Weather Finder by replacing the `API_KEY` variable in `setup/api_key.txt` with your API key.
